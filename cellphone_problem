                price.
                A setManufact method that accepts an argument for the manufacturer. This method
                allows us to change the value of the manufact field after the object has been created, if
                necessary.
                A setModel method that accepts an argument for the model. This method allows us to
                change the value of the model field after the object has been created, if necessary.
                A setRetailPrice method that accepts an argument for the retail price. This method
                allows us to change the value of the retailPrice field after the object has been cre-
                ated, if necessary.
